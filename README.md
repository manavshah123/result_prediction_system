# result_prediction_system
Here we are giving some datasets of mid sem exam and apply a regression algorithm to that dataset.  using Tkinter we create one temporary UI that gets data from a user and predicts the result. 

# Inspiration
When I am attending college that time I am like if I have my mid sem result then how I know how many marks I am getting in the Final exam. so according to it, I prepared much better so, it's not only my issue all student are facing the same issue that's why I tried to solve this, I know that's not 100% accurate but still, I am working on it 

# What it does
It's getting their mid sem marks with one GUI which I create using **Tkinter** and applying **regression** algorithm on it. so when a user enters their marks then it predicts their future result.

# How we built it
I create using **Tkinter** and applying **regression** algorithm on it. 

# What's next for Student Result prediction system
In the future, I am trying to give a big dataset and try to build this with maximum accuracy
